Too often, people believe that they need to wait until the cold weather is gone before they make their move in the market. Today, I’m here to bring you seven reasons you shouldn’t wait for the ground to thaw before you hammer in that For Sale sign.

**1. Less inventory equals more attention.** Serious buyers are out in full force at this time of year, and there are far fewer homes for them to look at than during other times of the year. This means that your home has a great opportunity to stand out. So, make sure it does. Remember: You can’t sell something that isn’t for sale.

**2. Job relocation.**When companies move their employees around, they like to schedule these relocations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. Only during winter months will you have a chance to capture these buyers.

**3. Locked-in Realtors.** Agents who are representing buyers at this time of year are definitely going to want to see your property at this time of year. Don’t miss your opportunity to take advantage of the high levels of buyer interest you’ll see in the winter.

**4. No landscaping? No problem.** Winter is an easy time to show your property. During winter, you don’t need to worry about spending hours on mowing the lawn or trimming the bushes. Let the elements take care of all of that. As long as your home looks clean and presentable, you’re good to go.

5. **Lighter square foot.** There are fewer buyers during this time of year, which means fewer people will be coming through your home. Of course, as I mentioned in the first point, the buyers that will be looking at your home are more serious and attentive.

6. **Faster sales.** Usually during the winter, the transaction will move more quickly. Loan officers and other people you’ll work with won’t be juggling as many transactions as they would be at other times of the year. This means that all the focus will be on you and your sale will probably move more quickly.

7.** Higher price.** Winter’s lack of inventory and high level of serious buyers means you will likely be able to get a better deal than during other times of the year. Typically, you’ll earn at or above your list price.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
