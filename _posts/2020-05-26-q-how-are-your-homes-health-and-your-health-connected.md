Today I’m introducing a new segment called “Two Minutes With Todd,” which will give you the lowdown on important real estate topics in just two minutes. The first topic is your health and your home’s health. To maintain either, you need to make a plan and follow through with it.&nbsp;

**To go further in depth on this topic, you can watch a more detailed version of the video click on the button below.**

**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[![](/uploads/capture.JPG){: width="181" height="45"}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTkqbk6IeJI&amp;t=1143s){: target="_blank"}**

During these trying times, your health can vary greatly, whether you love to workout or would rather stay in your pajamas all day. The same goes for your house, whether you’ve paid attention to its upkeep or have let things go.&nbsp;

**One of the key factors of maintaining your health is making a plan.** Nobody likes to wake up in the morning and think about exercising, but if you have that written down, you’re more likely to actually exercise. You need a plan for your home’s health too.&nbsp;

Think about all of your home’s mechanicals: the furnace, air conditioner, water heater, electrical system, etc. These things need to be maintained on a biannual basis, so put a plan together and get it in writing just like you would with your fitness goals.&nbsp;

Also, keep in mind that you can turn back the clock for both your health and your home by completing small tasks throughout the days, weeks, months, and years. This way, these tasks don’t accumulate. This is especially important for when it’s time to sell your property, because if you take care of these tasks consistently, you’ll be ready to sell\!

As always, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. In the meantime, stay safe, be kind to one another, and I look forward to talking to you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
