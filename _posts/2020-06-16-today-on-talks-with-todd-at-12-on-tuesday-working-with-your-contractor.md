If you’ve been following “Talks With Todd at 12 on Tuesday,” you know that during a [recent video](https://www.facebook.com/findlouisvillelistings/videos/353097862002535/), we talked about how to search for and vet contractors if you have a honey-do list of summer home renovations to get started on.&nbsp;

What happens after you find the contractor you want, though? That’s the question I’ll answer today. **Joining me once again is my guest JC, and I’ve provided timestamps of the conversation in the video above so you can skip to various sections at your leisure:&nbsp;**

**1:36—**What season is best for renovating your home?

**4:28—**What factors should you consider before scheduling your summer renovation?

**7:53—**If you’ve scheduled a vacation while the renovation is being done, what should your due diligence be regarding your contractor and your home?

**9:14—**Wrapping things up&nbsp;

If you have a topic you’d like to see me discuss in a future video of this series, feel free to call or email me and I’d be happy to oblige.

If you know anyone thinking of buying, selling, or investing in real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I’d love to speak with you.
