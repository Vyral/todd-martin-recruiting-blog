<center>We have great news to share: We’re growing and have an awesome new name.</center>

We have some exciting news\! As 2020 came to a close and 2021 began, we made some great decisions. Drum roll please: Moving forward, **our brokerage will now be called Call It Closed International Realty**. The best part is that we’re not going anywhere.&nbsp;

Not only have we continued to serve our friends and clients in Kentucky, but we’ve also expanded into the Indiana market; we now serve every part of Kentucky and Indiana. From Louisville and Lexington to Indianapolis and Fort Wayne and every small town in between, we’d be delighted to help with all your real estate needs. Additionally, we have a network of agents across the country that can help you move to or from any area. We’re still here to help you.&nbsp;

We look forward to serving our clients under this excellent new name and with fantastic new tools with the ability to help you even more. **We’re officially your Kentuckiana real estate resource\!**&nbsp;
