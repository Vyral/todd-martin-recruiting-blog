Here’s a quick look at what the home-buying process entails via CQP.

It’s time for the third and final part of our “CQP” series. Today we’re covering the final letter, the process, from beginning to end.&nbsp;

First, take that initial step to understand where you want to be and what you want to do. Are you a renter for life, or do you truly want to own a property? To be a property owner, you have to commit to the process. You have to qualify, too.&nbsp;

**The process starts with a call from you to us.** We need to discover what matters most to you. We need to figure out your current living situation, making mortgage payments in arrears, and coordinating a situation where you won’t have overlapping rent and mortgage payments.

The next step is qualifying you with a mortgage lender. We’ll find out the different loans you can qualify for and which one is best for you. That also determines how we write the contract to protect you as a buyer. If at any point you’re having problems in the transaction, we’ll make sure you're comfortable and protected.

How long does the process take? It all depends on how long it takes you to find a house. Supply is limited right now, and finding the right house is the hardest thing that buyers are running into. **Once you do find the home, the process is 25 to 45 days typically after your offer is accepted.** That’s when the loan process starts.

Your lender is going to ask you for documents along the way, so make sure you're committed to the process by having copies of all your important financial documents in a folder that you can send to your lender when they need it.

We’re here to be your liaison and help you every step of the way. You’re not going to go broke, but you just might create wealth over time through real estate. Successful home purchases happen when we bring the commitment, qualifications, and process together.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home, CQP, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
