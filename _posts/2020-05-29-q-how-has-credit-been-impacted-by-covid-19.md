For today’s message, I'm discussing a recap of a recent conversation with Brian Schutte of Ruoff Mortgage, my longtime lending partner and friend, to discuss the rapidly changing mortgage world and how borrowers can best position themselves on the market. In response to the uncertainty and fear surrounding COVID-19, mortgage companies tightened up their lending requirements as a precautionary measure—after all, risky lending precipitated the 2008 housing crash.&nbsp;

Now that we’re months into this pandemic and everyone has a chance to adjust (as best they can), rates and requirements have begun to ease back down. Brian is here to help us make sense of it all.&nbsp;
