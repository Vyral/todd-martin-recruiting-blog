As a real estate agent, how do you plan on bettering yourself in 2017?

As we look to progress forward, we all try to set goals. **One of the interesting things I find about setting goals is that you have to work backwards in accomplishing them.** By that, I mean you have to have a goal, and then you have to figure out how to achieve that goal.

For example, if your ultimate goal for 2017 is to go to Disney World, the question becomes, “What do you have to do to get there?” First, you’ll have to do things like set your travel schedule, arrange hotel accommodations, and plan your itinerary for when you arrive. After that, you’ll have to calculate how much the trip is going to cost. Once you determine those factors, you’ll need to figure out how many houses you’ll have to sell in the first place to make the trip happen.

This is something we at the Todd Martin Group can help you with: **we can examine your goals and break them down for you.** We can look at your set appointments, your met appointments, and your sign appointments and figure out how many people you have to talk to, get under contract, and complete a transaction with to accomplish whatever your ultimate goal may be.

A crucial concept in doing this is **goal setting and tracking.**&nbsp;For example, I have my own list of items that I track that are critical to accomplishing my goals for 2017:

* Marketing
* Sales
* Operation
* Finance
* People (e.g., your database)
* Faith
* Family
* Fun
* Fitness

If you’re interested in learning about the Todd Martin Group and how we can help you obtain your goals so you have a wonderful 2017, feel free to reach out to me. All phone call and/or email conversations are strictly confidential. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
