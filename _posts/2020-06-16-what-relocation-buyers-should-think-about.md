If you’re thinking of moving and relocating to a new area, what factors do you need to take into consideration?

That’s the question I’m answering today on the latest episode of “Talks With Todd on Tuesday at 12.” In short, there are several important factors to consider, but it all depends on your situation and why you’re moving in the first place.&nbsp;

Joining me once again to discuss this topic in full is JC, and for your convenience, **I’ve provided timestamps of the video above so that you can jump to various sections:**

**1:14**—What type of person are you?

**2:18**—What if you come from more of a traditional neighborhood?&nbsp;

**3:03**—What style of house do you like?

**4:35**—The importance of talking to your Realtor&nbsp;

**5:30**—We can sell your house for free if you think you made a mistake relocating

**6:05**—Setting up your network of professional services before you move&nbsp;

**7:03**—The most difficult part of the move: hiring the movers&nbsp;

**7:47**—Wrapping things up

If you have any more questions about this topic or you’d like to get the relocation process started for yourself, give me a call or send me an email today. I’d be happy to help you.
