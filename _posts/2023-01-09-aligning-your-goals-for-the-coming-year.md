Welcome to 2023. How are you going to align yourself with the new year? I'm not talking about resolutions. I'm talking about aligning your goals. There are many ways to align yourself to achieve your goals this year. The best approach will depend on your specific goals and needs. I've compiled a few tips below that might help you.&nbsp;

**First, set SMART goals.** This stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.They will help you stay focused and motivate you to work toward your objective. For example, one of our objectives is to help a minimum of 50 families this year, which meets the SMART criteria.&nbsp;

Next, break your goals down into smaller and actionable steps, then create a schedule to follow. To achieve our goal, we have specific daily goals to reach out to people. We're also going to get organized and create systems and routines to help us stay on track.&nbsp;

After that, we're going to seek support. Surround yourself with people who will encourage and motivate you. **Consider finding a coach or mentor to help you stay accountable.** Staying motivated can be hard, but you need to find ways to stay engaged as you work toward your goals. This might involve setting rewards for yourself. Also, be open to adapting your plan as needed, and don't be afraid to make adjustments if you encounter challenges or setbacks along the way.&nbsp;
