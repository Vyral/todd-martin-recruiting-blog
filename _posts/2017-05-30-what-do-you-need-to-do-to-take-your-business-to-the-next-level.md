Now that spring has sprung, we’re looking at having one of the best years the real estate market has ever had. How can you take your business to the next level?

While new business is great, **your goldmine is your previous clients and your sphere of influence.** Make sure you’re reaching out and marketing to those past clients. You need to have a system in place that will help you follow up and make sure you reach them on a regular basis.

One of the things we do for our clients is send out our video blog twice a month just to stay in touch. We also make sure we call them on their anniversaries and birthdays. These are things you don’t necessarily have to ask for but can obtain at closing and put into your database.

Another thing we’ve learned is that **business brochures, cards, and other marketing materials can boost your business**, and we have our own personalized card we send out to clients. We ask them for their business during the beginning, middle, and end of the process, in addition to when we follow up with them. We make it easy for them to contact us by giving them a website address, a phone number, or a section on our card that they can fill in.

If you want to take your business to the next level, I would be happy to sit down and talk with you about how you can do it. If this interests you or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to call or or shoot me an email. Talk to you soon!
