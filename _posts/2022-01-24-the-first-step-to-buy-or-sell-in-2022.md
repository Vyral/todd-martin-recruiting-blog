<br>I hope everyone is off to a great 2022\! The new year is time for resolutions, but how can you actually achieve what you want? Today I’m coming to you live from my ‘mobile office’ to talk about setting goals.

One big thing to remember is that there’s a difference between setting goals and setting specific goals. For example, a general goal could be that you want to lose weight. However, a specific goal would be that you want to lose 10 pounds by March 31. **If you don’t have a plan to achieve your goal, it probably won’t happen.&nbsp;**

By February, most people give up on their new year’s resolutions. If you are looking to buy or sell a home this year, you need to start planning now, and the first step is to make a little bit of progress. If you call my team, we can put together a specific plan with a definite beginning and ending.&nbsp;

**There’s a lot to keep track of when buying or selling**—it’s why most people don’t do it alone. If you give my team a call, we can help you through every step of the process. For example, you may actually want to keep some of your credit card debt if you’re looking to purchase. We can help you make a plan on how to pay off your bad debt while keeping your good debt.&nbsp;

The truth is, there will always be roadblocks to set you back. If you work with us, we can help you navigate them and set you up for success. Just give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
