Your appointments drive your income. The more appointments you have, the more likely you're going to have closings. Since inventory drives our business, if you have more listing appointments, you'll have more control over the outcome.

How can you convert more of your appointments? **One of the best things you can do is to have a pre-listing package.** If your pre-listing package goes out to your potential clients before your meeting, it's going to do so much of the heavy lifting for you.

At the Fine Homes Group, our pre-listing package has some of our marketing materials and a plan, the listing contract, the seller's disclosure, and all kinds of other pre-work that we ask our clients to do. We even give them a folder with “homework.” When we meet with the client, if the homework is filled out, there's a good chance that we're going to get that listing. This system allows us to close more of our appointments more quickly.

If you're interested in knowing more about what our pre-listing package looks like, I’d be happy to share one with you. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us; we look forward to hearing from you.
