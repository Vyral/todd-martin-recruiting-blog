So you've already purchased your home and you're getting ready to settle down and start a family. What do you do to protect it? That depends on where you are in your life, whether you moved up or down, and whether this is your first home.

**Many fail to look at how to protect their assets and this asset is one of the largest purchases that you will ever make.** Your home needs to be protected. If you were to pass away or become incapacitated, how would you take care of your loved ones? Would they be strapped with bills or would they get kicked out of the home that you worked so hard to get?

**Life insurance is one way to protect your assets.** You have homeowners insurance in case a meteor falls through your roof and leaves a big gaping hole. You have car insurance just in case there's a major accident. Why wouldn't you have life insurance to cover the loved ones that live with you? &nbsp;Even if you're a single person and you've purchased your home, do you have somebody who could benefit should you pass away? Consider protecting your assets by getting life insurance and talking to a financial expert.&nbsp;
