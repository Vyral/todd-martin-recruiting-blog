  One of the most important decisions you’ll be making when you buy a home is
  whether you should purchase a new construction home or a pre-existing one.
  Certain key factors like cost, time, and resources will affect which option
  you select. New homes are, well, new, and that can bring a homeowner a number

  properties.  Feel free to follow along in the video above, or you can use the
