Though many have a negative association with the term ‘spring cleaning,’ taking the time to clean up your home, both inside and out, can do wonders not just for your home’s value and appearance, but also your mental health. My guest Gaby and I sat down for a discussion about which spring cleaning projects are best, and why it’s a good idea to ultimately cross those items off your list.
