As we know, the spring and summer seasons are prime times for selling your home. However, there are a few factors that could cause your home to decrease in value, which my guest JC Moore and I will discuss today on “Talks With Todd on Tuesday at 12.”

**Feel free to follow our discussion in the video above, or you can use the timestamps below to navigate the conversation at your leisure:**

**1:40—**The first factor that can affect your home’s value: The “bone structure” of the house

**5:26—**A few smaller tasks that can increase your home’s value&nbsp;

**8:59—**Take advantage of the summer season to boost your curb appeal

**11:08—**Wrapping up our discussion

Regardless of whether you plan to sell in the near future, maintaining your home never hurts. Making your home a nice-looking, structurally sound one is part of what makes it comfortable to live in for you and your family, not to mention it makes your property more attractive to buyers in case you do end up selling.
