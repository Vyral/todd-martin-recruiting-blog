Let’s breakdown what it means to commit to the buying process.

Last time, we talked about three things that buyers fear in today’s market: commitment, qualification, and preparedness. In continuation of that topic, today I want to break those three concepts down even further, starting with commitment.

As I mentioned in my last video, you have to be committed to the home-buying process. That involves selecting an agent to commit to, who can then guide you through the transaction from beginning to end.&nbsp;

**You also need to be financially committed as a buyer.** That means you need to understand on a financial level what you’re getting yourself into. Financial commitment starts with selecting a loan officer; think of this as the corner piece to the home-buying jigsaw puzzle. Everything else will fall into place once you’ve undergone this step. Your officer will ask you for certain documents like W-2s, pay stubs, full bank records, and any other information they need, so have these things on hand for when they request them.

Finally, **you need to personally commit to the process.** In this market, you’re bound to get some bumps and bruises along the way. Almost every home on the market is receiving multiple buyers, so understand that you may not get the first home you bid on, and don’t be too heartbroken about it if that happens. There’s always a reason that a deal doesn’t go through; we may not know what that reason is, but something better always comes along for my clients.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, you’re more than welcome to reach out to us. In the meantime, stay tuned to my blog for the next breakdown in my series: qualification.
