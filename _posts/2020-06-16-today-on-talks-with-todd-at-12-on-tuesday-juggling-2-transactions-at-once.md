On today’s episode of “Talks With Todd at 12 on Tuesday,” we’ll discuss how to buy and sell a home at the same time.

In short, the best way to juggle these simultaneous transactions is to have a plan of action, give yourself a cushion to make the transition between homes as smooth as possible, have a contingency plan in place, and pick a financing option that reflects your situation.
