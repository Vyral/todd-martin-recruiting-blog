{% include youtube.html %}Lead conversion is near and dear to my heart because it's how we get clients and stay in business. The cost per lead from lead-generation sources can be quite exorbitant, so it's important to get the most out of all your sources.
<br>
<br>First, you want to  **be sure you've got a good lead follow-up system in place.**An MIT study revealed that if someone registers for your site online, you have a 100% greater chance of making contact with them if you follow up within five minutes versus 30 minutes. It also found that contacting that lead within five minutes gives you a 21% greater chance of getting them qualified. Speed is the key to online lead conversion.\*\*
<br> {% include pullquote.html %}\*\*
<br>**Since you need a system in place, you should run a client relationship manager, or CRM.**This is basically your database. Depending on your database, you need these systems in place. For example, we do a 21-day blast; when someone registers online, they automatically get a text message and email, and the agent who gets assigned the lead receives a text message about it as well. It lets them know that they need to call the lead within that five-minute window or else the lead will go to somebody else who is readily available.
<br>
<br>Remember, time is of the essence when trying to call and convert a lead.
<br>
<br>Once you have your CRM and system in place and you start talking with these leads, you'll be able to know if it's a hot buyer, a nurture, or just somebody kicking tires who you don't want to waste your time with.
<br>
<br>If you don't have these systems in place and you'd like to learn more about them or anything in terms of converting leads better, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to talk with you and help with your lead conversion.
