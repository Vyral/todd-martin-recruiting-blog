2020 has been a crazy year, and I want to take a moment to thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your Realtor and your go-to resource for all things real estate. During this time of year, I urge you to look at what you have to be thankful for. Weâ€™ll all get through this crazy year together\! I hope you have a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving. To see my full holiday message (including an aerial tour of Louisville provided today by yours truly), watch my latest video.&nbsp;
