Lately, a lot of people have been asking, “Is now the right time to jump into the real estate market?”

I would absolutely say yes. Why? The current market is phenomenal. We are coming off some amazing gains and the best real estate market we’ve seen in awhile.

There is a lot of pent-up frustration from buyers who have been in the market for the last year trying to find a home. Due to low inventory, many buyers have not been able to make a purchase yet. Not only that, interest rates are slowly creeping up, so we have plenty of people ready to buy a home. Our team has a lot of business going right now.

“We need new team members to help us with all of this great business!”

As we come into the first of the year, there are some great grant programs available for first-time buyers, so we have a lot of options to help home buyers in 2017.

That said, if you’re interested in a career with the Todd Martin Group, we are looking for someone to join our team. We need someone to help us manage all of this great business! Plus, our Guaranteed Lead Program will get you 30 to 50 leads a month. We will also show you how to convert those leads.



So, if you’re ready to jump into the real estate market or start your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!
