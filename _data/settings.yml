  about_markdown: >-
    I have been in real estate for over 15 years. After owning an
    &nbsp;international real estate franchise for several years I realized that
    I could take better care of my clients and customers at the local level.
    With past experience in corporate america combined with 26yrs of service in
    the military (Navy, Army and Air Force) this seemed like the right move. I
    decided to open my real estate company and base the company on the highest
    level of customer service possible.&nbsp;


    Over the years I have discovered that real estate is more than business. it
    is about life, whether you are starting out, moving up or simply settling
    down everyone I have ever had the pleasure of working with is in a different
    place in life. I understand and&nbsp; strive to make each experience unique
    and as meaningful as possible.
